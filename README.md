# hello-world

Hi all!

I'm Nina and I'm trying to improve my programming skill.
I have experience developing stuff in .NET, using C# and VB, but I am far from good and I would like to be better!
I also have experience with Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Flow and Microsoft PowerApps, and I find them interesting!
